class PipeInstruction:
    """Base class for all instructions to be executed by the pipeline engine.

    All keyword arguments are stored as members similar to a ``namedtuple``. These are
    then accessible to the :class:`PipeEngine` during execution.

    Each instruction has following attributes:
    1. stage_id: pipeline stage that the instruction should be executed by.
    2. micro_batch_id: the ID of data micro batch that this instruction should be executed on.
    3. step_id: usually used by generation schedules, identical to generation token id.
    4. priority: priority of the instruction, higher priority instructions should be scheduled first in
                 the dynamic schedule.
    5. deps: list of instructions that this instruction depends on.
    6. bind: Instruction that this instruction is binded with. Binded instructions are send/recv instructions
             that should appear in pair, belong to different (adjancent) stages and have the same micro_batch_id.
             Two binded instructions should have the same dependency list. This feature is used to avoid NCCL
             communication deadlock.
